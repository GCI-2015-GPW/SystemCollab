# System Collaborator

This is a MIT-licensed online collaboration system.

How it works is it runs a VM (or docker, haven't decided yet) behind the scenes, and you can (in real time with your friends) work on it. Think google docs for this.

## Appeal
* Creation of powerful online collaborative tools: you can create a server in the VM and have the user connect to it. Everything is shared so you don't have to worry about keeping everything in sync
* Amasing modularity. Because this is a linux VM, there is no restrictions: do whatever you want
